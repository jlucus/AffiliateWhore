## Improve on the following system:
The current system only shows total deposits, date of last deposit, and the total commissions earned. However, we need to identify clear metrics that account for the possibility of players winning large amounts without hurting the score so long as the players are in profit.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage
data = []
num_players = int(input("Enter number of players: "))
for _ in range(num_players):
    data.append(prompt_player_data())
